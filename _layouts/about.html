		        		Bird up!ðŸ¦… I'm a product-oriented user experience designer. I graduated with a major in human rights and a specialization in computer science and design, where I conducted research at the Computational Design Lab and wrote a <a href="/assets/about/kairavillanueva_seniorthesis.pdf" target="_blank">thesis</a> on designing user localization for the home page of the National Hurricane Center.

						I care about thoughtful design that empowers users.  I believe in the principles of transparent information and democratic choice, as such usability and human dignity are two factors that I emphasize in my designs. Philosophies of Joseph Weizenbaum, Richard Buchanan, and <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2019.00019/full" target="_blank">Simon McCarthy</a> are amongst the ones that have greatly influenced my design framework. Iâ€™m endlessly researching better ways to improve my methods, and enjoy hearty discussions on the past, present, and future impacts of technology design across various cultures.
