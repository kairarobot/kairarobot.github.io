Ahh... 21<sup>st</sup> century living. Calling someone from a remote location without access to local landline used to be a privilege almost two decades ago. Communication is now instant, and this opens up more resources for exchanging information. I used to wait for hours listening to the radio with a pen and paper ready at hand, and when that "one" song finally comes up, I jotted down the lyrics as fast as I can to catch the lyrics. Today, I can browse through a list of songs that have been broadcasted. Convenience drives the marketplace, and who knew that such convenience can fit in a pocket.

The average youth ranging from 17-24 years old now spend more than 27 hours online a week<sup>1</sup>. 86% of people would admit to spending some time in social media while they are at work<sup>2</sup>.  The statistics do sound a bit patronizing, but this is not about starting a campaign on "doing better things other than going online", rather a notice on informational consumption.  

1.       What am I consuming?

2.       Who produces what I consume?

3.       How am I processing what I have consumed?

4.       When do I need to consume?

<strong>What am I consuming?</strong>

When I go online, I usually peruse through twitter for a few minutes, and I often hit the heart button for images of weird animals or news related to environment or games. It is pretty unfortunate to say but the general agreement is this: what you publicly consume online is what you become online. Taking responsibility of what type of information you are taking in reflects your brand, and how your profile is viewed to the public.

<strong>Who produces what I consume?</strong>

If you’re reading material from any of these sources: Allure, Architectural Digest, Ars Technica, Bon Appétit, Brides, Condé Nast Traveler, Details, Epicurious, Glamour, Golf Digest, Golf World, GQ, Lucky, The New Yorker, Pitchfork Media, Self, Teen Vogue, Vanity Fair, Vogue, W and Wired—it all stems from one publisher, Condé Nast. Publishers do a remarkable job shaping the content they want to produce. These production companies have their own set of guidelines that they follow, and doing a little reading on how certain sources are related to one another would contribute in clearing biases buried in between the lines. Know the companies that produce the product you use. 

<strong>How am I processing what I have consumed?</strong>

When a tragic incident occurs, often times, it would be covered by local and major news channel.  It’s almost impossible to block the constant feed of information overload from these sources. Absorbing news of the same calamity over and over is not healthy. So take a second, and pause, or physically disengage yourself from these materials. 

<strong>When do I need to consume?</strong>

I started giving myself a time range on when I should check my email. Habits develop overtime, and it takes a while to deconstruct habits, so scheduling when to do something and mostly sticking to that plan would undoubtedly help in managing time and breaking old habits. If it is not necessary, then why do it? Allocate different time duration for different sources.

Sustainability is the state of maintaining resources, and that includes us amongst the amount of information we are surrounded by everyday.
