There are many ways to approach learning <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> and this is one of many. I'm also a firm believer that education should be <em>free</em> and I cringe whenever I think about the Catch-22s and underpinning of the current tech hype. Learning a skillset requires a sustainable income to buy a seat into a programming bootcamp with neck-breathing mentoring. Mostly everyone from the middle and working class can't afford to <em>not</em> work. Hence, I'm curating this with <strong>free</strong> resources alone. Don't spend a penny on the same resource that's packaged differently.

Ruby on Rails is a web application framework designed around Ruby, so it is recommended to start off with Ruby first before jumping into Rails. Ruby in itself is a particular language, and even though I'm familiar with other programming languages (Python, Java, C++, etc.) there are little things in Ruby that makes me <em>think</em> differently when I'm problem solving. So yes, learn Ruby first, then Rails!

<h2>Learn Ruby First</h2>
<p>You should be in a comfortable level of familiarity once you go through these Ruby resources especially if you tackle the optional recommendations. The important part is to remain consistent, and one way to track that is by logging your study hours.</p>

<h3>Ruby</h3>
• <strong><a href="https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/">Learn Ruby the Hard Way</a></strong> - Chapters are short but is compensated by a sizable amount of problem sets
 Does not hold your hand and problems <em>could</em> be hard but doable

• <strong><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/ruby">Codecademy's Ruby</a></strong> - Interactive environment with no need to install Ruby and could be a bit repetetive with no push for understanding

<h3>Optional Ruby</h3>
• <strong><a href="http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/">Programming Ruby: The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide</a></strong>

• <strong><a href="/assets/blogassets/100916/learn_to_program_chris_pine.pdf">Learn to Program - Chris Pine</a></strong>

<h2>Learn Ruby on Rails Second</h2>

<h3>Beginner</h3>
• <strong><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/ruby-on-rails-intro/home">Coursera: Ruby on Rails Introduction</a></strong> - Provides a lecture format with quizzes, homeworks, and projects. Also gives a little leg room for the student to do some independent research and development

<h3>Intermediate</h3>
• <strong><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/rails-with-active-record/home">Coursera: Rails with Active Record and Action Pack</a></strong> - Provides a lecture format with quizzes, homeworks, and projects with the same format as the beginner version but focuses on the back-end

• <strong><a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/book">Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl</a></strong> - Filled with exercises and projects--could be a bit dry but worth the over drive

<h3>Advanced</h3>
• <strong><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/agile-development-using-ruby-rails-uc-berkeleyx-cs169-1x">Agile Development Using Ruby on Rails - Basics</a></strong> - Review of Ruby programming language basics with an emphasis on Ruby on Rails Model-View-Controller (MVC) development framework

• <strong><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/agile-development-using-ruby-rails-uc-berkeleyx-cs169-2x">Agile Development Using Ruby on Rails - Advanced</a></strong> - Apply Agile techniques to enhance and refactor legacy code with use of JavaScript to enhance applications by adding relationships between models


<h3>Optional Rails</h3>
• <strong><a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails">The Odin Project: Rails</a></strong>

• <strong><a href="http://railscasts.com/">Rails Casts</a></strong>

One last tip, do not copy and paste, <em>please</em>. Examine the material thoroughly, and if you're feeling a little stuck, take a glance at other solutions, or ask for help, but don't verbatimly use someone else's answer. There is also no sense in reinventing the wheel, so read through the documentation. It's okay if you don't get it at first because "if there is no struggle, there is no progress" and being uncomfortable is a good place to be in when you're learning.
