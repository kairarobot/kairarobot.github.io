New year, new projects! At first, I wanted to refine a journaling application I did a few months back, [Lewis and Clark](https://github.com/Zovfreullia/Lewis-and-Clark), but a good part of me is screaming "hardware" and I just have to go for it. This is the first of many posts where I will be talking about my process of creating a pH meter application that will be connected to a pH probe.

Alright, so why a pH application? 

The short answer is river quality. 

And the long answer?

Back when I was in high school, I participated in a research over the summer with my best friend. We took a trip down the local marshes with Mr. Durso, her biology teacher. We worked with The Hackensack River Keeper to measure and pack live oysters, and I remember having a little-girl crush on one of the lead researchers as he explained how oysters would act as natural filterers in the polluted river. After all the measurements have been recorded, we kayaked to drop-off zones and plopped the oysters in the river. Roughly after 4-6 years, the oysters did not make it. The river was so polluted to the point where it killed the oysters.

One of the main components for tracking river quality is its pH level. The acronym stands for power of hydrogen. pH measures the concentration of hydrogen ions in water, which are calculated by taking the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion(H+). 

<strong>ph = -log(H+)</strong>

As the pH increases, fewer free hydrogen ions float around. One change in pH means a dramatic change in the amount of hydrogen ions. The scale ranges from 0 to 14. 

ph range for acid 0 - 6

ph range for base 8 - 14

And yes, as you might have guessed, 7 is considered neutral. Most rivers have pH normally varying between 6.5 and 8.5. 

A river is an ecosystem, and there are abiotic materials and biotic organisms that are directly affected by the pH level. Lead, copper, or cadium, when exposed to lower pH levels become more solulble, which makes the river toxic, especially for humans.

The purpose of this project is to create more citizen scientists! I want everyone to have access to an application that will measure pH levels for them. Down the line, I think a database would also help in collecting this information so bi-weekly graphs can be posted to track the changes in pH levels.
