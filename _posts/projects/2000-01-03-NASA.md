research: Air pollution is prevalent, especially in densely populated areas. Collaborating with Dr. Shobhana Gupta, we came up with feasible questions that are appropriate to ask users about the quality of air they are breathing. The target audience is widespread. This application has a neutral scope and is intended for anyone who has access to an iOS device.
tools: Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Xcode, Objective-C
process: As a NASA Datanaut, I was assigned the task to develop an app that crowd-sources information for comparing changes in environmental factors, such as temperature, relative humidity, air pollution, with occurrence of symptoms of allergies and respiratory diseases. This is an iOS prototype that stores information using Google's Firebase. The application displays a qualitative survey asking for the user's breathing rate.
