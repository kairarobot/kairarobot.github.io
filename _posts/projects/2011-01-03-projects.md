Zetron is a retro cyberpunk local multiplayer game. The game is currently available for the iOS, and users can download it for free. A world where everyone is a cyborg—part machine and part human. People’s senses are ten times heightened and they are are now able to complete tawdry tasks, such as washing their laundry and paying their bills in lightning fast speed. The thought of catching the flu is no longer a thought, because the flu no longer exists! But little do they know, there is a virus capable of crushing their precious civilization, waiting for the opportune moment to strike. Zetron is a computer virus that takes over the software system embedded within the cerebral cortex of human beings. Unfortunately, there is no cure once someone is infected, and the outcome is death. The only way to survive is to avoid those who have already contracted Zetron.
