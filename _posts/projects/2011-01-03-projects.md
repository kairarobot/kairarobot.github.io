research: The audience we were targeting consists of anyone who is interested in party games, and those who are specifically keen on moving around. When we were designing the game, we wanted to make sure that there is a constant stream of physical interaction between the players. Usually, mobile games are sedentary. We wanted to do something that will keep everyone on their feet. The video game is an iOS application that uses Bluetooth connection to augment the game of tag.
process: We realized that wifi may not be accessible in certain areas. To increase the accessibility, we opted for Bluetooth. On top of using Bluetooth as our main connection, we also integrated Bluetooth as part of the core game mechanic. Bluetooth functions with RSSI (Received Strength Signal Indication), and we basically used the RSSI as a key factor to determine whether someone is tagged with the “Zetron” virus. When players join a server, someone is randomly given the Zetron virus. The infected individual must maintain a certain proximity near another person in order for them to contract the virus. The antagonist of the game infects other players, and the rest of the players need to survive the timed round.
