research: When I was a teaching-fellow in my C4Q cohort, we were given a project to create an iOS application that involved timers. Overall, the theme was up to each group. My team had two people (including myself). We realized that exercise or workout applications had various types of timers for each varied activity. The target audience includes anyone who lift weights, have personalized workouts, spar, or want preset drills. 
tools: Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Xcode, Objective-C
process: We decided to go with green as a theme to represent a constant need for movement. A green traffic light is a universal indicator of going forward. We made sure to continuously use the word “go” as part of the design as that would invoke users to naturally repeat the name of the application for marketing purposes. The application is literally a collection of various timers.
