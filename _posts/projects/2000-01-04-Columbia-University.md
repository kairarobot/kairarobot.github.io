research: The current team needed a way to create simple web pages without resorting to websites like Squarespace, Wix, or WordPress. I had to research several static website generators, and present one that is the best suited for the team at CCNMTL (Columbia Universityâ€™s Center for New Media Teaching and Learning). I ended up using Jekyll because the liquid formatter is friendly, and designers who are not keen on sifting through code could easily append a post, and that post could be converted into a component on the website. 
tools: Jekyll, HTML5, SCSS, JavaScript
process: The original website can be accessed <a href="http://html5up.net/helios">here</a>. This was a project I did for Columbia University's <a href="http://welcome.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/">Center for New Media Teaching and Learning</a>(CCNMTL). This is the converted version of the original into a <em>Jekyllified</em> format. Users can add posts and it appends each post as a card in the carousel. With this Jekyll ready template, content is easier to add and manage without needing to dig through several files of HTML. All the user has to do is edit the post, similar to Drupal's or WordPress's content WYSIWG creator.
