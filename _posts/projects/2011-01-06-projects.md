Meme Generator uses the camera and photo components of the iPhone. 
The first view asks the user for camera access, and then the view shows the main 
screen where “Enter Stuff Here” can be replaced with the meme-text. The image 
can be retrieved using either the library or camera. Pressing “Gimmeh” would show 
the image with the text, where the text can be moved around. There’s an option 
to save the current meme or create a new one.
