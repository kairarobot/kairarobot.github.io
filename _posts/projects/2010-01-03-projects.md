research: ClassLinkâ€™s main application is OneClick, which essentially acts as a launch pad or dashboard for students, teachers, and administrators to quickly access their added applications by means of single-sign on.  I was tasked to redesign a start-up wizard to ease the process of onboarding new ClassLink users. I had to bear in mind that the design needs to be user-friendly to both children and adults.
process: The process took a couple of iterations before arriving at the final process. I initially used Figma to design the mock-ups, then moved to CodePen, and finally converting the project into an Angular 6 application. There are five steps--choosing a profile image, setting up password, enabling two-factor authentication, linking social accounts, and setting up other methods of signing on via QR code and facial recognition. The left side is a complete demarcation of the process. Therefore, the user can easily see the current progress of their profile setup.
