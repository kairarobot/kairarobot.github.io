research: Many of the users that will use the ClassLink Badging application consists of teachers and students, as well as administrators in school districts. Badges are used to gamify the classroom as validated indicators of accomplishment, skill, quality, or interest. The teachers or admins often distribute the badges, and the students receive them. Therefore, designing the badges required more attention to the visual cue of the students.
tools: Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Figma
process: These are templates and not fixed badges, so users can customize the icon and text of the badge. There are three different types of badges. I separated them into three sets. The first set consists of badges with only text, the second set consists of badges with only an image, and the last set of badges have both text and image. I have also curtailed a specific range of colors for these badges. Each color palette consists of five colors, and each color in a palette is established with a certain amount of brightness, which keeps the badges consistent. I mainly used Illustrator to design the badges, and later exported the badges to Figma for ease of access.
