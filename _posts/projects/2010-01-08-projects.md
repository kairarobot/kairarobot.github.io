Rewired is a <i>Jekyllified</i> template I made for Columbia University's <a href="http://welcome.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/">Center for New Media Teaching and Learning</a>(CCNMTL). The live website is consistently iterated with new content. Updating content can pile up, and this may disrupt the work flow of developers and designers if they are stacked with small but imperative tickets. The <i>Jekyllified</i>  version is made for non-developers and non-designers to add and change content with ease.
