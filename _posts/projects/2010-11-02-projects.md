Working with Jamaal Sedayao, we built GO, an exercise time tracker available for iOS. In two weeks, we were able to implement a polished product with several features. The application is centralized around timers. Each section is a tailored to a specific task that is matched with its own clock. You can customize your workouts, or follow a set routine, or even do a boxing round. Though I am satisfied with its current build, I want to rewrite the application in Swift.
