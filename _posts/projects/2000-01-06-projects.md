research: ClassLink App Library is a component of a larger application, OneClick. Essentially, OneClick is a launch pad for other application where students and teaches can access the applications they need in one place. Most of the users are students, which can range from kindergarten to twelfth grade. The former design conformed to a decade old paradigm that had glossy buttons and weird navigation. I helped with pushing the design forward to a simpler layout.
tools: Figma, HTM5, SCSS, JavaScript
process: I was tasked with converting the final design into a responsive and interactable website. The former component used Bootstrap and jQuery, which were both heavy frameworks for this type of implementation. I decided to simplify the process and opted to write the front-end with pure HTML5, SCSS, and JavaScript. I also used CodePen as a storage and display for the code, so the project is easily shareable.
