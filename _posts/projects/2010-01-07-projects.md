This is a twine game that was inspired by a snow storm. I live in New Jersey, and our winters are more than mild. I wanted to translate the boxed-in paranoia that is induced by cabin fever. Have you seen <i>The Shining</i>? I was unironically creeped out by the blizzard and  was experiencing anxiety, so I turned it into <i>this</i>.
