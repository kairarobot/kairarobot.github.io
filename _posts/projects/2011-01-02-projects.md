<b>Abstract:</b>

Honeybee colony collapse disorder is a pressing ecological concern. The conservation of Apis-mellifera is emphasized due to their pollination services; crop yields are dependent on their efficacy as pollinators. Addressing the weaning population of honeybees has brought efforts in increasing the numbers of managed honeybees to compensate for loss or lack of natural presence. Augmenting a population may seem like a solution but itâ€™s temporal. Managed honeybees themselves are declining. Apis-mellifera is but a single factor within the pollination network. Examining pollination requires linking relationships between its abiotic and biotic components. This mini-review will provide an observation on pollination network beyond Apis-mellifera.
