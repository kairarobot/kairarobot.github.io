Lewis and Clark started from my urgency to mitigate the overpopulation of deer in Northern New Jersey by tracking them down. I wanted to use this application to take pictures of each deer I encounter. As I was building this application, I realized that this should not only be for deer, but for both plants and animals I observe in the wild. The first screen will list all the entries. Each entry is marked with a photo, location (longitude and latitude) of where that photo was taken, and additional text and audio logs for further record tracking. You can also access an internal Wikipedia. And if you want to trace back your steps, there is also a compass that takes in latitude and longitude coordinates.
