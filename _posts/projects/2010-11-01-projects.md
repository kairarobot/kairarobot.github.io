Crystal Ball is an iOS application that dictates your fortune through emojis. This application was brainstormed and developed with my friend, Zoufishan Mehdi. We came up with a working prototype that reads out loud your questions and spits out your emoji fortune. We're not sure yet if we want to submit this to the Apple Store but maybe we will!
