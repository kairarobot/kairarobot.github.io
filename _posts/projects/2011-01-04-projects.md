As a NASA Datanaut, I was assigned the task to develop an app that crowd-sources information for comparing changes in environmental factors, such as temperature, relative humidity, air pollution, with occurrence of symptoms of allergies and respiratory diseases. At the moment, this is an iOS prototype that stores information using Google's Firebase. The application displays a qualitative survey asking for the user's breathing rate. More questions related to health and air pollution will be added.
