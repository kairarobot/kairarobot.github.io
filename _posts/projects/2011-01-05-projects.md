Argus is an augmented reality framework for iOS Swift applications. 
I have also made Argus into a CocoaPod, which can be installed by 
simply adding a Podfile into the application and running pod install. 
Argus works by layering the camera over the view controller, and adding 
another view layer on top of the camera. This application is made to enhance 
user-interface that requires real-time view of the nearby surroundings. The example 
below shows a simple text on top of the real-time camera background.
