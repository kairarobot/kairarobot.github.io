The original website can be accessed <a href="http://html5up.net/helios">here</a>. This was a project I did for Columbia University's <a href="http://welcome.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/">Center for New Media Teaching and Learning</a>(CCNMTL). This is the converted version of the original into a <i>Jekyllified</i> format. Users can add posts and it appends each post as a card in the carousel. With this Jekyll ready template, content is easier to add and manage without needing to dig through several files of HTML. All the user has to do is edit the post, similar to Drupal's or WordPress's content WYSIWG creator.
