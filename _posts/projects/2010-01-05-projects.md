research: Many of the users that will use the ClassLink Badging application consists of teachers and students, as well as administrators in school districts. Badges are used to gamify the classroom as validated indicators of accomplishment, skill, quality, or interest. The teachers or admins often distribute the badges, and the students receive them. Therefore, designing the badges required more attention to the visual cue of the students.
process: The original website can be accessed <a href="http://html5up.net/helios">here</a>. This was a project I did for Columbia University's <a href="http://welcome.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/">Center for New Media Teaching and Learning</a>(CCNMTL). This is the converted version of the original into a <em>Jekyllified</em> format. Users can add posts and it appends each post as a card in the carousel. With this Jekyll ready template, content is easier to add and manage without needing to dig through several files of HTML. All the user has to do is edit the post, similar to Drupal's or WordPress's content WYSIWG creator.
