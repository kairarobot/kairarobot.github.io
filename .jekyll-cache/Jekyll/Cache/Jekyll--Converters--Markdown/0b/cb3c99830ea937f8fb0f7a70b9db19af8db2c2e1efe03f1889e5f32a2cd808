I"f<p>Ahh… 21<sup>st</sup> century living. Calling someone from a remote location without access to local landline used to be a privilege almost two decades ago. Communication is now instant, and this opens up more resources for exchanging information. I used to wait for hours listening to the radio with a pen and paper ready at hand, and when that “one” song finally comes up, I jotted down the lyrics as fast as I can to catch the lyrics. Today, I can browse through a list of songs that have been broadcasted. Convenience drives the marketplace, and who knew that such convenience can fit in a pocket.</p>
