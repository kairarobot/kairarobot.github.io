I"@<p>One week from now, it will be March 25th, which marks the day last year when I submitted my application to Columbia College Information Technology (CCIT). Before interning at CCIT, I was roughly prototyping static websites and CMS (content management systems) were foreign; handling the bare-bones functionality of WordPress was the extent of my knoweldge in CMS. CCIT’s development stack is wrapped around Drupal, an open-source CMS. When I thought of Drupal then, I rememeber words like <em>open-source</em> and <em>CMS</em> that hoisted a sense of caliber, but these are merely technical jargon and nothing more. Instilling prestige in software or culture is unheatlhy, and I’m glad I broke this pattern of thought before it broke me down. Having said that, the experiece I had at CCIT was irreplaceable and valuable.</p>
