      <h2>Discovery</h2>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>Vestwell empowers workplaces with its digital recordkeeping platform, providing more flexibility to manage retirement plans for advisors, employers, and employees. I worked across different projects and managers to design and deliver internal and client-facing experiences for the platform.
      <br /><br />
      One of the client-facing projects I had the opportunity to design is Vestwell's onboarding experience. My role for this project is a user experience designer and researcher focusing on making the platform more informative, relative, and welcoming for new users. 
      </p>
      <h3>Problem Statements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Stakeholders automatically enrolled in retirement plans via their employees need a proper introduction to the platform</li>
        <li>Relevant information from the stakeholder that would help with their retirement plan is left blank until the stakeholder chooses to input it, such as household income or beneficiaries</li>
        <li>Stakeholders receive an email stating they enrolled in a retirement plan but nothing more, which creates a passive interaction</li>
        <li>Stakeholders with a light understanding of retirement are left in the dark to figure out the financial jargon directly on the platform</li>
        <li>There are no entry-point for new users to understand how the retirement platform works.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Increase retirement knowledge for new users to navigate the platform confidently</li>
        <li>Immediately receive and store relevant retirement information about the user before the user accesses the application, such as annual income, beneficiaries, and investment options</li>
        <li>Reduce confusion and inquiries by providing a step-by-step process that allows users to see what makes up their retirement plan</li>
        <li>Set a standard for user engagement instead of dropping them off on the platform by providing information on what the application can do for them and what they can do on the application.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Literature Research</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Onboarding slides help users feel welcome</li>
        <li>If done well, onboarding can establish further trust between the user and the product</li>
      </ul>
