I"<p>I think it’s safe to assume that I will probably build another iOS app that needs Firebase down the line, so might as well document the installation process! Firebase is a cloud service for mobile and web applications. There are more options for web applications in terms of cloud service, but as for mobile, the choices aren’t as vast. Before Firebase, I was using Parse, and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/25/facebook-parse/">it was bought by Facebook</a>, so there goes that mobile-friendly cloud storage.</p>
