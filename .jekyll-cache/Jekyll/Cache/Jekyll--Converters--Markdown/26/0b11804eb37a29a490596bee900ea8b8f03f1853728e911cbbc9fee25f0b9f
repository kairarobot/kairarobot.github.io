I"ó<p>I donâ€™t want to use Appleâ€™s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/MessageUI/Reference/MFMailComposeViewController_class/">MFMailComposeViewController</a>, since this has a custom view controller that swerves away from my applicationâ€™s user interface. I want to send emails immediately with one press, similar to a newsletter, and not do it one by one. An alternate solution is Mailgunâ€™s API. I used Mandrill separately for the web version of the application.</p>
