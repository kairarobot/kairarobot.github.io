		<h1>DISCOVERY</h1>
		<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
		<div class="two-column">
			<p>While working on my thesis, my advisor, Professor Robert Soden 
			(http://robertsoden.io/) recruited me as a researcher where I collaborated 
			with a team of sociologists, product designers, and computer scientists 
			between Columbia University, University of Washington: Seattle, and 
			University of Colorado: Boulder to assess a website redesign for the 
			National Hurricane Center.</p>

			<p>As a result, we presented 18 design opportunities to the National 
			Hurricane Center, and one of the opportunities they picked is designing 
			for user localization, which is the focus of my thesis, ‚ÄúExploring User 
			Localization as a Design Opportunity through Human-Centered Design 
			Principles for the National Hurricane Center Home Page (NHC.NOAA.GOV).‚Äù</p>

		<h2>RESEARCH GOALS</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>In a state of emergency during a hurricane, how do we provide 
			users information relevant to their situation?</li>			
			<li>Which information is important to display in order for them to 
			make the best decision that would ethically suit their needs? </li>
			<li>What do users look for when assessing the risk of a hurricane?</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>INTERVIEWS</h2>
		<div class="two-column">
			<p>35 interviews were conducted remotely through Zoom. There are three 
			categories of questions that we used: demographics, past experiences with 
			disasters, and post concerns. We interviewed participants across the United 
			States that were in locations susceptible to hurricane disasters. The 
			initial part of the process focuses on the demographics and background, 
			mostly asking how long they have lived in their current residency, or if
			they have any prior training related to disasters or severe weather.</p>

			<p>These questions generally assess for experience and familiarity of 
			users to hurricanes which would help in constructing the display of the 
			home page. The next set of questions aimed at how they were able to retrieve
			hurricane information, and the actions that they have taken based on the 
			lack of or known information. 4 themes were generated from the inteviews, 
			and 166 codes were collected. Afterwards, the theme I focused on is 
			information seeking and sources.</p>
