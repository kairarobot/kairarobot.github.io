		<h1>DISCOVERY</h1>
		<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
		<div class="two-column">
			<p>While working on my thesis, my advisor, Professor Robert Soden 
			(http://robertsoden.io/) recruited me as a researcher where I collaborated 
			with a team of sociologists, product designers, and computer scientists 
			between Columbia University, University of Washington: Seattle, and 
			University of Colorado: Boulder to assess a website redesign for the 
			National Hurricane Center.</p>

			<p>As a result, we presented 18 design opportunities to the National 
			Hurricane Center, and one of the opportunities they picked is designing 
			for user localization, which is the focus of my thesis, “Exploring User 
			Localization as a Design Opportunity through Human-Centered Design 
			Principles for the National Hurricane Center Home Page (NHC.NOAA.GOV).”</p>

		<h2>RESEARCH GOALS</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>In a state of emergency during a hurricane, how do we provide 
			users information relevant to their situation?</li>			
			<li>Which information is important to display in order for them to 
			make the best decision that would ethically suit their needs? </li>
			<li>What do users look for when assessing the risk of a hurricane?</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

		<h2>INTERVIEWS</h2>
		<div class="two-column">
			<p>35 interviews were conducted remotely through Zoom. There are three 
			categories of questions that we used: demographics, past experiences with 
			disasters, and post concerns. We interviewed participants across the United 
			States that were in locations susceptible to hurricane disasters. The 
			initial part of the process focuses on the demographics and background, 
			mostly asking how long they have lived in their current residency, or if
			they have any prior training related to disasters or severe weather.</p>

			<p>These questions generally assess for experience and familiarity of 
			users to hurricanes which would help in constructing the display of the 
			home page. The next set of questions aimed at how they were able to retrieve
			hurricane information, and the actions that they have taken based on the 
			lack of or known information. 4 themes were generated from the inteviews, 
			and 166 codes were collected. Afterwards, the theme I focused on is 
			information seeking and sources.</p>

		<h2>COMPETITOR ANALYSIS</h2>
		<div class="two-column">
			<p>After all of the code reviews, 18 opportunities were presented to 
			the National Hurricane Center. They provided their feedback and mentioned 
			that they would like to see a design for user localization. From that point 
			on, the first thing I did is conducted a competitor analysis to check 
			how other applications are utilizing user localization on their home pages. 
			Patterns started appearing, such as defaulting to user localization where 
			the application would directly show the results without asking or a search 
			input bar that asks for a zip code. Over 60 applications were audited for 
			user localization.
			</p>

			<p>Weather.com is interesting because this acts as two-fold: automatic 
			and manual geolocation. The automatic geolocation is used on the front 
			page, and since Weather.com relies on ads, they could take advantage of 
			the automated geolocation to cater to a specific audience. The NHC could 
			use this same technique, and on the front-page, it could automate the 
			geolocation and check if the area has any upcoming hurricanes or alerts. 
			Websites that sell products are often given the option to pick up an item 
			via store, and the stores listed are based on proximity to the user’s 
			location (retrieved via geolocation).</p>
