		<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
		<div class="two-column">
			<p>While working on my thesis, my advisor, Professor Robert Soden 
			(http://robertsoden.io/) recruited me as a researcher where I collaborated 
			with a team of sociologists, product designers, and computer scientists 
			between Columbia University, University of Washington: Seattle, and 
			University of Colorado: Boulder to assess a website redesign for the 
			National Hurricane Center.</p>

			<p>As a result, we presented 18 design opportunities to the National 
			Hurricane Center, and one of the opportunities they picked is designing 
			for user localization, which is the focus of my thesis, “Exploring User 
			Localization as a Design Opportunity through Human-Centered Design 
			Principles for the National Hurricane Center Home Page (NHC.NOAA.GOV).”</p>
