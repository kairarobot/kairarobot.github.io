		<h1>DISCOVERY</h1>
		<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
		<div class="two-column">
			<p>While working on my thesis, my advisor, Professor Robert Soden 
			(http://robertsoden.io/) recruited me as a researcher where I collaborated 
			with a team of sociologists, product designers, and computer scientists 
			between Columbia University, University of Washington: Seattle, and 
			University of Colorado: Boulder to assess a website redesign for the 
			National Hurricane Center.</p>

			<p>As a result, we presented 18 design opportunities to the National 
			Hurricane Center, and one of the opportunities they picked is designing 
			for user localization, which is the focus of my thesis, ‚ÄúExploring User 
			Localization as a Design Opportunity through Human-Centered Design 
			Principles for the National Hurricane Center Home Page (NHC.NOAA.GOV).‚Äù</p>

		<h2>RESEARCH GOALS</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>In a state of emergency during a hurricane, how do we provide 
			users information relevant to their situation?</li>			
			<li>Which information is important to display in order for them to 
			make the best decision that would ethically suit their needs? </li>
			<li>What do users look for when assessing the risk of a hurricane?</li>
		</ul>
