<h3>Research</h3>

<p>Shubzilla is a nerd core rapper who mainly raps about her principal views and of course, video games. With that said, the target audience are folks who are into video games or media that falls under the umbrella of topics in her raps. The website is targeted for collaborators and fans, so they can easily view tour dates, current music and videos, as well as understand a little bit more about Shubzilla. The website is organized into a single page scroll for faster access.</p>

<h3>Processs</h3>

<p>Shubzilla provided me with image references from Fallout (video game) and screenshots from Godzilla. Most of the images have a consistent theme of an element that is either in flames or in smoke. Keeping that in mind, I went with a palette that resembled these themes but I did not want the website to feel harsh, so I used a gradient and softer and warmer reds to represent the look she wanted.</p>
